    "We now need to find areas in which collisions occur frequently. This will let us identify collision-prone areas in NYC. All the collisions we have right now have their latitude & longitude information, which is too granular to identify areas. We also have the borough and Zip codes of the locations, but those are not granular enough. What we need to do is to define 'clusters' from the locations of crashes, which we can use to determine areas. We can use the k-means algorithm to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we try to optimize the number of means to give us a good balance of error & generalizability. While we can do that here as well, we can manually choose the number of means to specify how granular we'd like to be with our zoning: selecting a single mean will, naturally, cover the entire NYC metropolitan area but won't provide us with any additional information. By visually observing the results of choosing from a number of means, we can find a good balance of the number of zones that translate logically to the layout of the NYC metropolitan area."
