Analyzing NYC Traffic Collision Data
====================================

The official repository for the CMU 15-688 project, created by [Ahmet Emre Unal](https://github.com/aemreunal) and [Marco Peyrot](mpeyrotc.github.io).

To run the notebook it is required to install the following packages via pip:

    * colour

and download the NYPD_Motor_Vehicle_Collisions data as a csv file. This file is located at this [site](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95/data) and must be put in the same directory as the rest of the files in our submission. Download it via the Export option.

The nbviewer link that we submitted for evaluation is [this](). 

A point of consideration is that plotting on the map requires the generation of html files which you can open
at any given time to view information.

Finally, we used data, information and code from the following sources:

    * Bicycle lane information was obtained from http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/lane-list.shtml
    * The API and code to generate and plot the map of NY was taken from http://leafletjs.com/
    * Course slides and homework.
