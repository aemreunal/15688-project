Analyzing NYC Traffic Collision Data
====================================

The official repository for the CMU 15-688 project, created by [Ahmet Emre Unal](https://github.com/aemreunal) and [Marco Peyrot](mpeyrotc.github.io).

The notebook depends on a number of third party Python libraries, including:

 * `numpy`
 * `pandas`
 * `scikit-learn`
 * `BeautifulSoup`
 * `matplotlib`
 * `seaborn`
 * `colour`
 * `geopy`
 * `PIL`

You can install them via pip to run the notebook.

The main data source for this project is the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset, available [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95/data). Download this as a CSV file (via the 'Export' option) and put it to the project's root folder.

The notebook can be viewed through [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aemreunal/15688-project/blob/master/NYC%20Traffic%20Collision%20Data.ipynb).

Data, information and code from the following sources have been used in this project:

 * Bicycle lane information was obtained from [NYC local government website](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/lane-list.shtml)
 * The API and code to generate and plot the map of NYC was taken from [here](http://leafletjs.com/)
 * Course slides and homeworks
